# AkumaUtils
it's a chattriggers module, idk why I put it on github and not made it downloadable on the website
who knows, maybe I will someday. I'm writing this on midnight, anyway

## How to install
1.
 Install the ChatTriggers mod from https://www.chattriggers.com/ and put it into your mods folder
 Use the 1.8.9 stable version
2. Launch minecraft (1.8.9 forge)
**After your game is launched**
3. Go to your .minecraft directory (%appdata%/Roaming/.minecraft) and then head to `config/ChatTriggers/modules`
4. Get the latest version of AkumaUtils and extract it into the directory
5. In-game type the command `/ct reload`
6. You're done!
