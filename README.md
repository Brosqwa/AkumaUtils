# AkumaUtils
A ChatTriggers module that provides some random utilities for the AkumaMC minecraft server
it's a chattriggers module, idk why I put it on github and not made it downloadable on the website
who knows, maybe I will do that one day

## How to install
1. Install the ChatTriggers mod from https://www.chattriggers.com/ and put it into your mods folder
 (Use the 1.8.9 stable version)
<br>
2. Launch minecraft (1.8.9 forge)
<br>
**After your game is launched**
<br>
3. Go to your .minecraft directory (%appdata%/Roaming/.minecraft) and then head to `config/ChatTriggers/modules`
<br>
4. Get the latest version of AkumaUtils and extract it into the directory
<br>
5. In-game type the command `/ct reload`
<br>
6. You're done! It should tell you that AkumaUtils has loaded

## How to configure
there isn't a config yet, you have to edit the config file :D
<br>
in `%appdata%/Roaming/.minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules/AkumaUtils/data` open the `config.json` file<br>
edit the values however you want<br>
some things that you should know:<br>
`enabled` can only be `true` or `false` otherwise it will probably break<br>
`x` and `y` can only be numbers otherwise it will break<br>
X: 0 and Y:0 is the top left corner of the screen<br>
Increasing `x` moves it to the right<br>
Increasing `y` moves it down
