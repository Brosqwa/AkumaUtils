# AkumaUtils
A ChatTriggers module that provides some random utilities for the AkumaMC minecraft server<br>
it's a chattriggers module, idk why I put it on github and not made it downloadable on the website<br>
who knows, maybe I will do that one day<br>

## How to install
### Skip the first 2 steps if you've used ChatTriggers already
1. Install the ChatTriggers mod from https://www.chattriggers.com/ and put it into your mods folder<br>
 (Use the 1.8.9 stable version)<br>
2. Launch minecraft (1.8.9 forge)<br>
**After your game is launched**<br>
3. Go to your .minecraft directory (%appdata%/Roaming/.minecraft) and then head to `config/ChatTriggers/modules`<br>
4. Get the latest version of AkumaUtils and extract it into the directory<br>
5. In-game type the command `/ct reload`<br>
6. You're done! It should tell you that AkumaUtils has loaded<br>

## How to configure
There is a config now, just do /akumautils<br>
